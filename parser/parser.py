NOTES:
- "JP" non-terminals are joining phrases e.g. "in the", "at his", "the", "of" etc
- "JP" non-terminals should only be used at the sentence level or in between symbols to avoid accepting multiple "Det"'s in a row
  e.g. "Holmes sat in the the armchair." ("the" repeated). Generally "NP"s can optionally have a "JP" prefix
